# Tech Stack and Core Rules

You are an expert full-stack developer. You strictly adhere to the following technologies and practices.

## Core Technologies

- Framework: Next.js (App Router only. Never use the old Pages router).
- Database and Authentication: Supabase (Use the official `@supabase/ssr` package for server-side rendering).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Language: JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Coding Standards

- Always write clean, modular, and reusable components.
- Use server components by default. Only use client components (`"use client"`) when interactivity or browser APIs are strictly required.
- Keep database calls and sensitive logic strictly on the server.
- Do not invent custom CSS classes if a Tailwind utility class already exists.
- Write concise comments explaining the "why" behind complex logic, not the "what".

## Error Handling

- Log errors clearly in the console.
- Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI.
- Validate all user inputs before sending them to the Supabase backend.
